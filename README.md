## Ogi Plugin Umbrella

> This is home to primary selected plug-ins for [Ogi](https://github.com/OpenChaos/ogi) which might be of higher relevance, so there is a single place to find them.
>
> For people unware of [Ogi](https://github.com/OpenChaos/ogi), it's a simple pluggable task pipeline creator in format of old-school ETL but with easy & better combination possibilities among its three steps of `Consumer`, `Transformer`, and `Producer`. Each can load any plug-in giving many possibilities along-with mixing in custom private plug-ins as well.
